# no-more-anony-msg

I was fucking tired of `sarahah` or `stulish` app on social platform like Facebook, So I decided to spam on `sarahah` or `stulish` users
by sending message flood through DDoS attack, and this tool does that job nicely. Just provide the target recipient username
and a text file path containing line separated messages you want to send, and  then run the command, keep running that process for 1 or 2 hours,
you are done, the target recipient would be compelled to uninstall the app from their phone 😁.

> A DDoS attack hacking tool to create message flood to the recipient of Sarahah or Stulish apps.
